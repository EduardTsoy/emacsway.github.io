<p>There is an opinion that a team should be broken by three layers: junior, middle and senior.</p>
<p>The truth is that it&#8217;s enough to have at least one weak developer in the team to lose a lot of time for the whole team.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>There are two ways of constructing a software design: one way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. (C. A. R. Hoare)</div></blockquote>
<p>Do you know the Primary Technical Imperative of software development?</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Managing complexity is the most important technical topic in software development. In my view, it&#8217;s so important that Software&#8217;s Primary Technical Imperative has to be managing complexity.

<p>When developer writes code, he 91% of the time reads code, and only 9% of time he types text from keyboard.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>You might ask: How much is code really read? Doesn’t most of the effort go into
writing it?</p>
<p>Have you ever played back an edit session? In the 80s and 90s we had editors like Emacs
that kept track of every keystroke. You could work for an hour and then play back your whole
edit session like a high-speed movie. When I did this, the results were fascinating.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the playback was scrolling and navigating to other modules!</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Bob enters the module.</li>
<li>He scrolls down to the function needing change.</li>
<li>He pauses, considering his options.</li>
<li>Oh, he’s scrolling up to the top of the module to check the initialization of a variable.</li>
<li>Now he scrolls back down and begins to type.</li>
<li>Ooops, he’s erasing what he typed!</li>
<li>He types it again.</li>
<li>He erases it again!</li>
<li>He types half of something else but then erases that!</li>
<li>He scrolls down to another function that calls the function he’s changing to see how it is called.</li>
<li>He scrolls back up and types the same code he just erased.</li>
<li>He pauses.</li>
<li>He erases that code again!</li>
<li>He pops up another window and looks at a subclass. Is that function overridden?</li>
</ul>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>You get the drift. Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading vs. writing is well over 10:1.
We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code.</p>
<p>Because this ratio is so high, we want the reading of code to be easy, even if it makes
the writing harder. Of course there’s no way to write code without reading it, so making it
easy to read actually makes it easier to write.</p>
<p>There is no escape from this logic. You cannot write code if you cannot read the sur-
rounding code. The code you are trying to write today will be hard or easy to write
depending on how hard or easy the surrounding code is to read. So if you want to go fast,
if you want to get done quickly, if you want your code to be easy to write, make it easy to
read.

<blockquote>
<div><p>&#8220;Dijkstra pointed out that no one&#8217;s skull is really big enough to contain a modern
computer program (Dijkstra 1972), which means that we as software developers
shouldn&#8217;t try to cram whole programs into our skulls at once; we should try to organize
our programs in such a way that we can safely focus on one part of it at a time. The goal
is to minimize the amount of a program you have to think about at any one time. You
might think of this as mental juggling—the more mental balls the program requires you
to keep in the air at once, the more likely you&#8217;ll drop one of the balls, leading to a design
or coding error.</p>
<p>At the software-architecture level, the complexity of a problem is reduced by dividing
the system into subsystems. Humans have an easier time comprehending several simple
pieces of information than one complicated piece. The goal of all software-design
techniques is to break a complicated problem into simple pieces. The more independent
the subsystems are, the more you make it safe to focus on one bit of complexity at a
time. Carefully defined objects separate concerns so that you can focus on one thing at a
time. Packages provide the same benefit at a higher level of aggregation.</p>
<p>Keeping routines short helps reduce your mental workload. Writing programs in terms
of the problem domain, rather than in terms of low-level implementation details, and
working at the highest level of abstraction reduce the load on your brain.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that programmers who compensate for inherent human limitations
write code that&#8217;s easier for themselves and others to understand and that has fewer
errors.&#8221;

<blockquote>
<div>Software&#8217;s Primary Technical Imperative is managing complexity. This is greatly
aided by a design focus on simplicity.
Simplicity is achieved in two general ways: minimizing the amount of essential
complexity that anyone&#8217;s brain has to deal with at any one time, and keeping
accidental complexity from proliferating needlessly.

<div>The number
&#8220;7±2&#8221; has been found to be a number of discrete items a person can remember while
performing other tasks (Miller 1956). If a class contains more than about seven data
members, consider whether the class should be decomposed into multiple smaller
classes (Riel 1996).
(«Code Complete» <a class="footnote-reference" href="#fncodec" id="id5">[2]</a>)</div></blockquote>
<p>Thus, when one developer writes an unreadable code for 9% of his time, this code slows down the development velocity of the whole team by 91%.
The code is written once, but is read incommensurably many times in the development process.</p>
<p>The emphasis on &#8220;fast writing&#8221; code actually leads to a reduction in the development velocity in geometric progression. And the emphasis on &#8220;readability&#8221; of code leads to an increase in the development velocity, also in an geometric progression.</p>
<p>If code is not readable, has a bad code navigation, a bad decomposition, a lot of code smells, hight coupling, low cohesion, violates SRP, OC principles, has poor test coverage, doesn&#8217;t uses type hinting and doesn&#8217;t allow to use automated refactoring, then this code slows rate of development for 91% of time of the whole team.</p>
<p>Thus, each developer in the team MUST be a senior developer.
The best way to achieve it is the XP by Kent Beck.</p>
<p>Experience sharing is the rule №1 for the high-skilled team.
If your team still has a junior developer after a few weeks, your team needs a better manager.</p>

<p>Team doesn&#8217;t have time to write high-quality code, because they have a hot deadline.</p>
<p>In reality you have the hot deadline because you have the unpredictable codebase which requires a lot of your time.
You spend a lot of time to try to understand messy mishmash of a code.
Sometimes you are able to understand the code only with debugger.
Your code has a poor test coverage, therefore you spend a lot of time for bugfixes.
Sometimes you are not able to implement a some feature due to poor design, but you also can&#8217;t to refactor the code because of the poor test coverage.
Your code has a lot of duplicates which are the cause of a lot of bugs.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The General Principle of Software Quality is
that improving quality reduces development costs.</p>
<p>Understanding this principle depends on understanding a key observation: the best way
to improve productivity and quality is to reduce the time spent reworking code, whether
the rework arises from changes in requirements, changes in design, or debugging. The
industry-average productivity for a software product is about 10 to 50 of lines of
delivered code per person per day (including all noncoding overhead). It takes only a
matter of minutes to type in 10 to 50 lines of code, so how is the rest of the day spent?
Part of the reason for these seemingly low productivity figures is that industry average
numbers like these factor nonprogrammer time into the lines-of-code-per-day figure.
Tester time, project manager time, and administrative support time are all included.
Noncoding activities, such as requirements development and architecture work, are also
typically factored into those lines-of-code-per-day figures. But none of that is what
takes up so much time.</p>
<p>The single biggest activity on most projects is debugging and correcting code that
doesn&#8217;t work properly. Debugging and associated refactoring and other rework consume
about 50 percent of the time on a traditional, naive software-development cycle. (See
Section 3.1, &#8220;Importance of Prerequisites,&#8221; for more details.) Reducing debugging by
preventing errors improves productivity. Therefore, the most obvious method of
shortening a development schedule is to improve the quality of the product and decrease
the amount of time spent debugging and reworking the software.
This analysis is confirmed by field data. In a review of 50
development projects involving over 400 work-years of effort and
almost 3 million lines of code, a study at NASA&#8217;s Software
Engineering Laboratory found that increased quality assurance was
associated with decreased error rate but did not increase overalldevelopment cost (Card 1987).</p>
<p>A study at IBM produced similar findings:</p>
<p>Software projects with the lowest levels of defects had the shortest development
schedules and the highest development productivity.... software defect removal is
actually the most expensive and time-consuming form of work for software (Jones
2000).</p>
<p>The same effect holds true at the small end of the scale. In a 1985
study, 166 professional programmers wrote programs from the
same specification. The resulting programs averaged 220 lines of
code and a little under five hours to write. The fascinating result
was that programmers who took the median time to complete their
programs produced programs with the greatest number of errors.
The programmers who took more or less than the median time
produced programs with significantly fewer errors (DeMarco and
Lister 1985).</p>
<p>The two slowest groups took about five times as long to achieve roughly the same
defect rate as the fastest group. It&#8217;s not necessarily the case that writing software without
defects takes more time than writing software with defects. As the graph shows, it can
take less.

<blockquote>
<div><p>Watts Humphrey reports that teams using the Team Software Process
(TSP) have achieved defect levels of about 0.06 defects per 1000 lines of code.
TSP focuses on training developers not to create defects in the first place (Weber
2003).</p>
<p>The results of the TSP and cleanroom projects confirm another version of the General
Principle of Software Quality: it&#8217;s cheaper to build high-quality software than it is to
build and fix low-quality software. Productivity for a fully checked-out, 80,000-line
cleanroom project was 740 lines of code per work-month. The industry average rate for
fully checked-out code is closer to 250–300 lines per work-month, including all
noncoding overhead (Cusumano et al 2003). The cost savings and productivity come
from the fact that virtually no time is devoted to debugging on TSP or cleanroom
projects. No time spent on debugging? That is truly a worthy goal!

<p>There is an opinion that pair programming reduces the velocity of development.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Studies at the Software Engineering
Institute have found that developers insert an average of 1 to 3
defects per hour into their designs and 5 to 8 defects per hour into
code (Humphrey 1997), so attacking these blind spots is a key to
effective construction.
(«Code Complete» <a class="footnote-reference" href="#fncodec" id="id8">[2]</a>)</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The primary purpose of collaborative construction is to improve
software quality. As noted in Chapter 20, &#8220;The Software-Quality
Landscape,&#8221; software testing has limited effectiveness when used
alone—the average defect-detection rate is only about 30 percent
for unit testing, 35 percent for integration testing, and 35 percent
for low-volume beta testing. In contrast, the average
effectivenesses of design and code inspections are 55 and 60
percent (Jones 1996). The secondary benefit of collaborative
construction is that it decreases development time, which in turn
lowers development costs.</p>
<p>Early reports on pair programming suggest that it can achieve a
code-quality level similar to formal inspections (Shull et al 2002).
The cost of full-up pair programming is probably higher than the
cost of solo development—on the order of 10–25 percent higher—
but the reduction in development time appears to be on the order of
45 percent, which in some cases may be a decisive advantage over
solo development (Boehm and Turner 2004), although not over
inspections which have produced similar results.
(«Code Complete» <a class="footnote-reference" href="#fncodec" id="id9">[2]</a>)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A number of these cases illustrate the General Principle of Software Quality, which
holds that reducing the number of defects in the software also improves development
time.</p>
<p>Various studies have shown that in addition to being more effective
at catching errors than testing, collaborative practices find different
kinds of errors than testing does (Myers 1978; Basili, Selby, and
Hutchens 1986). As Karl Wiegers points out, &#8220;A human reviewer
can spot unclear error messages, inadequate comments, hard-coded
variable values, and repeated code patterns that should be
consolidated. Testing won&#8217;t&#8221; (Wiegers 2002). A secondary effect is
that when people know their work will be reviewed, they scrutinize
it more carefully. Thus, even when testing is done effectively,
reviews or other kinds of collaboration are needed as part of a
comprehensive quality program.

<blockquote>
<div>Informal review procedures were passed on from person to person in the general culture
of computing for many years before they were acknowledged in print. The need for
reviewing was so obvious to the best programmers that they rarely mentioned it in print,
while the worst programmers believed they were so good that their work did not need
reviewing. (Daniel Freedman and Gerald Weinberg)</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In addition to feedback about how well they follow standards, programmers need
feedback about more subjective aspects of programming: formatting, comments,
variable names, local and global variable use, design approaches, the-way-we-do-
things-around-here, and so on. Programmers who are still wet behind the ears need
guidance from those who are more knowledgeable, and more knowledgeable
programmers who tend to be busy need to be encouraged to spend time sharing what
they know. Reviews create a venue for more experienced and less experienced
programmers to communicate about technical issues. As such, reviews are an
opportunity for cultivating quality improvements in the future as much as in the present.</p>
<p>One team that used formal inspections reported that inspections quickly brought all the
developers up to the level of the best developers (Tackett and Van Doren 1999).
(«Code Complete» <a class="footnote-reference" href="#fncodec" id="id11">[2]</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>Collective Ownership Applies to All Forms of Collaborative Construction</p>
<p>With collective ownership, all code is owned by the group rather than by individuals
and can be accessed and modified by various members of the group. This produces
several valuable benefits:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Better code quality arises from multiple sets of eyes seeing the code and multiple programmers working on the code.</li>
<li>The impact of someone leaving the project is lessened because multiple people are familiar with each section of code.</li>
<li>Defect-correction cycles are shorter overall because any of several programmers can potentially be assigned to fix bugs on an as-available basis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some methodologies, such as Extreme Programming, recommend formally pairing
programmers and rotating their work assignments over time. At my company, we&#8217;ve
found that programmers don&#8217;t need to pair up formally to achieve good code coverage.
Over time we achieve cross-coverage through a combination of formal and informal
technical reviews, pair programming when needed, and rotation of defectcorrection
assignments.

<li>It shortens schedules. Pairs tend to write code faster and with fewer errors. The project team spends less time at the end of the project correcting defects.</li>
