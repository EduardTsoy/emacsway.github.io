Very often, questions like;
<p>
<blockquote>

are asked. The following two articles are Ralph Johnson(one of the GoF ... authors of <i>Design Patterns</i>)'s

questions. They are originally discussed in the 'pattern-discussion@cs.uiuc.edu'mailing

<p>
&gt; Can anyone recommend any (good) papers, etc, that discuss the links between<br>
&gt; XP and patterns?<br>
</p>

<p>
As far as I know, there are none.  The closest is one by Joshua
Kerievsky<a href=#ref1>(*1)</a>that argues that patterns and XP go together, but it
isn't really about the links.  There are extremely strong links,
which isn't surprising if you realize that the same people invented
both of them, that they both grew out of the same little corner of
the programming community.  So, there are VERY strong social connections,
and there are also strong philosophical connections.  I think the latter
are due to the former.</p>

<p>
The way I tell the story, Kent Beck invented both XP and patterns. 
"Invented" is too strong a word, since all his good ideas were learned
with Ward Cunningham.  But Kent is the salesman/publicist, and he got
other people involved.  Ward and Kent discovered Christopher Alexander
in the mid 80's, and spent several years trying to get other people
to take him seriously.  I read A Timeless Way of Building

<a href=#ref2>(*2)</a>

 and A
Pattern Language

<a href=#ref3>(*3)</a>

 in 1988 or 1989, and thought it was interesting,
but couldn't see how to apply it.  At OOPSLA'90, Kent and I worked
on a pattern language for Hotdraw 

<a href=#ref4>(*4)</a>

and I was converted into an
Alexander fan.  Kent had a workshop in Colorado in 1993 where he
convinced Jim Coplien and Grady Booch that patterns were important.
As far as I know, all the early XP leaders were either from the patterns
community or from the Smalltalk community. </p> 

<p>
Kent took a different approach to marketing XP than he did to 
marketing patterns.  One of the many differences was that none
of his XP literature depends on Chistopher Alexander.  I think
that he thought that pointing typical software developers to
Alexander was a mistake, because they wouldn't understand him
and talking about Alexander's ideas tended to make people go
off-topic very fast.  He wanted people to stick to talking
about software.  He figured that the people who would get a lot
out of Alexander would read him anyway because of the patterns
literature.  Nevertheless, XP is based on Alexander's ideas
just as much as patterns are.  (Note that software patterns
are certainly not 100% Alexanderian)</p>

<p>
When I read Alexander the first three or four times, the ideas
that caught my attention were extreme incremental design and
the evil of master plans.  He claimed that the best places
were designed by a lot of people over time and that their
coherency proved that these people shared a common set of 
patterns, since they did not share a master plan.  Alexander
thought of patterns as transformations to a design. </p>

<p>
Kent thought that the patterns in Design Patterns

<a href=#ref5>(*5)</a>

 were too
big.  (See "Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns"

<a href=#ref6>(*6)</a>

).  His idea
of patterns were more like the catalog of refactorings that
Martin Fowler eventually wrote

<a href=#ref7>(*7)</a>.

 But XP itself is a sort of
pattern language.  I think Kent was influenced by Jim Coplien's
process patterns.  Patterns in "Design Patterns" and "Smalltalk
Best Practice Patterns" are product patterns.  XP is a set of
process patterns

<a href=#ref8>(*8)</a>.

But if you think of XP as a set of process
patterns, it is a very well defined pattern language that is
Alexanderian in many ways.  In particular, it is generative.
There are no patterns for reliability or ease of understanding,
but the "practices" work together to generate systems that are
reliable and easily understood.  Like patterns, each practice
has a name and can be learned on its own.  Like patterns, practices
work together and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
It is extremely iterative, and plans as little as possible.  </p>

<p>
So, in my opinion, XP is a pattern language for software development
that shows how to use Alexander's style of development for software.</p>

&gt; Some of the most important overlap between Agile processes and<br>

&gt;  - teams of self-organized individuals create<br>

<p>
I am amused when people say that XP conflicts with the QWAN, or that
patterns are incompatible with XP.  As far as I am concerned, patterns and
XP are "the first try" and "the second try" of Kent Beck to put Christopher
Alexander's ideas into practice.  Both of them are derivatives of the
Alexanderian philosophy.  XP is more derived from Christopher Alexander's
work than "Design Patterns"

<a href=#ref5>(*5)</a>,


because Kent was more strongly influenced by
Alexander than any of the gang of four.
</p>

<p>
When I read "A Timeless Way of Building"

<a href=#ref2>(*2)</a>


 back in 87 or 88, I was most
attracted by its emphasis on piecemeal growth.  Peacemeal growth is the way
nature works, it is how you get the QWAN, it is the ideal.  Software
engineering tends to denigrate piecemeal growth.  I'm a fan of refactoring

<a href=#ref9>(*9)</a>,

so I resonated with it right away.  XP emphasizes this more than the pattern
literature.  A lot of people read "Design Patterns" and think that they are
supposed to use the patterns in up-front design.  We didn't say that, but
they are reading their assumptions into it.  The GOF are fans of piecemeal
growth, but we didn't make that point in our book, and few pattern writers
do.  When it comes to piecemeal growth, XP is more Alexanderian than most
patterns literature.
</p>

<p>
Kent thought that "Design Patterns" did not emphasize emergent properties
enough, that they weren't "generative" enough.  XP emphasizes this much
more.  XP is propagated by a dozen patterns (there are actually a lot more)
that do not mention things like "ease of change" or "reliability" but that
are supposed to generate these properties if you follow the patterns.  XP
proponents claim that XP projects are more predictable and more likely to
deliver software on time, even though XP downplays long-term schedules.
</p>

<p>
On Kent's second try, he very carefully avoided mentioning Alexander.
Perhaps he thought that Alexander just confused people, and that it was
better to avoid ideas like the QWAN.  So, he invented a whole bunch of new
vocabulary to convey these ideas, things like "code smell" and "do the
simplest thing that could possibly work".  It reminds me of what Gregor
Kiczales has done repackaging reflection and calling it aspect-oriented
programming

<a href=#ref10>(*10)</a>.

If your ideas aren't selling in one package, repackage them
and see if you can reach a different market with them.  It is a good
strategy.
</p>

<p>
So, as far as I am concerned, Kent started two movements that are based on
Alexaderian philosophy, and the fact that we talk about Alexander more than
the XP crowd doesn't mean that we are closer to Alexander than they are.
