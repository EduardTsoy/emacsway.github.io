<p>Before digging deep into it, it would be nice to understand what Application Logic is and how it differs from Business Logic.</p>
<div class="section" id="layered-architecture">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id41">Layered Architecture</a><a class="headerlink" href="#layered-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the most cited definitions of key conceptual layers gives Eric Evans:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>User Interface (or Presentation Layer)</strong></dt>
<dd>Responsible for showing information to the user and interpreting the user&#8217;s
commands. The external actor might sometimes be another computer
system rather than a human user.</dd>
<dt><strong>Application Layer</strong></dt>
<dd>Defines the jobs the software is supposed to do and directs the expressive
domain objects to work out problems. The tasks this layer is responsible
for are meaningful to the business or necessary for interaction with the
application layers of other systems.
This layer is kept thin. It <strong>does not contain business rules</strong> or knowledge, but
only coordinates tasks and delegates work to collaborations of domain
objects in the next layer down. It does not have state reflecting the
business situation, but it can have state that reflects the progress of a task
for the user or the program.</dd>
<dt><strong>Domain Layer (or Model Layer)</strong></dt>
<dd>Responsible for representing concepts of the business, information about
the <strong>business situation, and business rules</strong>. State that reflects the business
situation is controlled and used here, even though the technical details of
storing it are delegated to the infrastructure. This layer is the heart of
business software.</dd>
<dt><strong>Infrastructure Layer</strong></dt>
<dd>Provides generic technical capabilities that support the higher layers:
message sending for the application, persistence for the domain, drawing
widgets for the UI, and so on. The infrastructure layer may also support
the pattern of interactions between the four layers through an
architectural framework.</dd>

<p>But what does the term Business itself mean?
Misunderstanding of this term often leads to significant design problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-business-logic">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id42">What is Business Logic?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-business-logic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The most authoritative explanation of the term <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.c2.com/?CategoryBusiness">Business</a> can be found, as usual, on the Ward Cunningham website:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Software intersects with the Real World. Imagine that.</div></blockquote>
<p>There you can find a definition of <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.c2.com/?BusinessRule">Business Rule</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A Business Rule (in a programming context) is knowledge that gets applied to a set of data to create new value. Or it may be a rule about how to create, modify, or remove data. Or perhaps it is a rule that specifies when certain processes occur.</p>
<p>For example, we have a rule about email addresses &#8211; when the Driver Name field on our object identifier changes, we erase the email address. When we receive a new email address, we make sure that it contains an &#8220;&#64;&#8221; sign and a valid domain not on our blacklist.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.c2.com/?BusinessLogicDefinition">Business Logic Definition</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Business logic is that portion of an enterprise system which determines how data is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Transformed and/or calculated. For example, business logic determines how a tax total is calculated from invoice line items.</li>
<li>Routed to people or software systems, aka workflow.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The term Business should be distinguished from the term <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.c2.com/?CategoryBusinessDomain">Business Domain</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>A category about the business domain, such as accounting, finance, inventory, marketing, tracking, billing, reporting, charting, taxes, etc.</div></blockquote>
<p>You should also distinguish Business from <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.c2.com/?BusinessProcess">Business Process</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A Business Process is some reproduceable process within an organization. Often it is a something that you want to setup once and reuse over and over again.</p>
<p>Companies spend a lot of time and money identifying Business Processes, designing the software that captures a Business Process and then testing and documenting these processes.</p>
<p>One example of a Business Process is &#8220;Take an order on my web site&#8221;. It might involve a customer, items from a catalog and a credit card. Each of these things is represented by business objects and together they represent a Business Process.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_logic">gives us the following definition of the term Business Logic</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>In computer software, business logic or domain logic is the part of the program that encodes the real-world Business Rules that determine how data can be created, stored, and changed. It is contrasted with the remainder of the software that might be concerned with lower-level details of managing a database or displaying the user interface, system infrastructure, or generally connecting various parts of the program.</div></blockquote>
<p>Let me summarize this in my own words:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Business Logic</strong></dt>
<dd>is a modeling of objects and processes of the domain (i.e., the real world).</dd>
<dt><strong>Application Logic</strong></dt>
<dd>is what provides and coordinates the operation of the business logic.</dd>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id43">Subtypes of Business Rules</a><a class="headerlink" href="#subtypes-of-business-rules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In &#8220;Clean Architecture,&#8221; Robert Martin divides Business Rules into two types:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Application-specific Business Rules</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Application-independent Business Rules</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Thus we find the system divided into decoupled horizontal layers—the UI, application-specific Business Rules, application-independent Business Rules, and the database, just to mention a few.</p>

</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Chapters 16, 20 and 22 of Clean Architecture explain in detail the types of Business Rules.
Although, Robert Martin allocate the separate category UseCase (Interactor) classes for Application-specific Business Rules, in practice, this level is often rounded to Application Logic level.
For example, Martin Fowler and Randy Stafford divide Business Logic into two types - Domain Logic and Application Logic:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Like Transaction Script (110) and Domain Model (116), Service Layer is a pattern for organizing <strong>business logic</strong>.
Many designers, including me, like to divide &#8220;<strong>business logic</strong>&#8221; into two kinds: &#8220;domain logic,&#8221; having to
do purely with the problem domain (such as strategies for calculating revenue recognition on a contract), and
&#8220;application logic,&#8221; having to do with application responsibilities [Cockburn UC] (such as notifying contract
administrators, and integrated applications, of revenue recognition calculations). Application logic is
sometimes referred to as &#8220;workflow logic,&#8221; although different people have different interpretations of
&#8220;workflow.&#8221;</p>
<p>- &#8220;Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture&#8221; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#fnpoeaa" id="id2">[3]</a> by Martin Fowler, Randy Stafford</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In some places, he is inclined to refer &#8220;Business Rules&#8221; to Domain Logic:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The problem came with domain logic: business rules, validations, calculations, and the like.</p>
<p>- &#8220;Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture&#8221; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#fnpoeaa" id="id3">[3]</a> by Martin Fowler</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And even he admits the presence of a certain vagueness:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Then there&#8217;s the matter of what comes under the term &#8220;business logic.&#8221;
I find this a curious term because there are few things that are less logical than business logic.</p>

<p>Since the purpose of creating an application is precisely the implementation of Business Rules, it is important to ensure their portability and to separate them from the Application Logic.
These two different kinds of rules will change  at different times, at different rates, and for different reasons - so they should be separated so that they can be independently changed <a class="footnote-reference" href="#fncarch" id="id5">[2]</a> .
Grady Booch said that &#8220;Architecture represents the significant design decisions that shape a system, where significant is measured by cost of change <a class="footnote-reference" href="#fncarch" id="id6">[2]</a> .&#8221;</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id45">Ways to Organize Application Logic</a><a class="headerlink" href="#ways-to-organize-application-logic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Four ways to organize Application Logic are widespread:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Orchestration Service (&#8220;request/response&#8221;, i.e. the service is aware of the interface of other services) aka Service Layer.</li>
<li>Choreography Service (Event-Driven, т.е. loosely coupled), which is a derivative of Command pattern and is and used commonly in CQRS applications.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/frontController.html">Front Controller</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/applicationController.html">Application Controller</a> (which are also kinds of Command pattern).</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><p>&#8220;A Front Controller handles all calls for a Web site, and is usually structured in two parts: a Web handler and a command hierarchy.&#8221;</p>

</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>&#8220;For both the domain commands and the view, the application controller needs a way to store something it can invoke.
A Command [Gang of Four] is a good choice, since it allows it to easily get hold of and run a block of code.&#8221;</p>
<p>- &#8220;Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture&#8221;  <a class="footnote-reference" href="#fnpoeaa" id="id8">[3]</a> by Martin Fowler and others.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>4. <a class="reference external" href="https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Use Case</a>, which also is a kind of Command pattern.
At 15:50 Robert C. Martin points to a <a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/Nsjsiz2A9mg?t=15m45s">parallel between Use Case and Command pattern</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, even <a class="reference external" href="https://refactoring.com/catalog/replaceFunctionWithCommand.html">Method Object</a> is a derivative of Command pattern.</p>
<p>Use Case is necessary because there is Application-specific Business Logic which does not make sense outside the context of the application.
It ensures that these application-specific Business Rules are independent of the Application Logic using inverse control (IoC).</p>
<p>If the Use Case did not contain Business Logic, then there would be no sense in separating it from Page Controller, otherwise the application would try to abstract itself from itself.</p>
<p>As you can see, varieties of the Command pattern are widely used to organize the Application Logic.</p>
<p>The listed methods organize, first of all, Application Logic, and only then - Business Logic, which is not obligatory for them, except for Use Case, because otherwise it would have no reason to exist.</p>
<p>With proper organization of the Business Logic, and high quality of ORM (if used, of course), the dependence of the Business Logic of the application will be minimal.
The main difficulty of any ORM is to provide access to related objects without mixing Application Logic (and data access logic) into Domain Models, this topic we will discuss in one of the next posts.</p>
<p>Understanding the common features of the methods of managing the Application Logic allows us to design more flexible applications, and, as a result, more painlessly change the architectural style, for example, from Layered to Event-Driven.
This topic is covered in part in Chapter 16 &#8220;Independence&#8221; of &#8220;Clean Architecture&#8221; by Robert C. Martin, and in section &#8220;Premature Decomposition&#8221; of Chapter 3 &#8220;How to Model Services&#8221; of &#8220;Building Microservices&#8221; by Sam Newman.</p>

<div><p>SERVICE - An operation offered as an interface that stands alone in the model, with no encapsulated state.</p>
<p>- &#8220;Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software&#8221; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#fnddd" id="id9">[4]</a></p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In some cases, the clearest and most pragmatic design includes operations that do not
conceptually belong to any object. Rather than force the issue, we can follow the natural contours
of the problem space and include SERVICES explicitly in the model.</p>
<p>There are important domain operations that can&#8217;t find a natural home in an ENTITY or VALUE
OBJECT . Some of these are intrinsically activities or actions, not things, but since our modeling
paradigm is objects, we try to fit them into objects anyway...</p>
<p>A SERVICE is an operation offered as an interface that stands alone in the model, without
encapsulating state, as ENTITIES and VALUE OBJECTS do. S ERVICES are a common pattern in technical
frameworks, but they can also apply in the domain layer.</p>
<p>The name service emphasizes the relationship with other objects. Unlike ENTITIES and VALUE
OBJECTS , it is defined purely in terms of what it can do for a client. A SERVICE tends to be named for
an activity, rather than an entity—a verb rather than a noun. A SERVICE can still have an abstract,
intentional definition; it just has a different flavor than the definition of an object. A SERVICE should
still have a defined responsibility, and that responsibility and the interface fulfilling it should be
defined as part of the domain model. Operation names should come from the UBIQUITOUS
LANGUAGE or be introduced into it. Parameters and results should be domain objects.</p>
<p>SERVICES should be used judiciously and not allowed to strip the ENTITIES and VALUE OBJECTS of all
their behavior. But when an operation is actually an important domain concept, a SERVICE forms a
natural part of a MODEL-DRIVEN DESIGN . Declared in the model as a SERVICE, rather than as a
phony object that doesn&#8217;t actually represent anything, the standalone operation will not mislead
anyone.</p>
<p>A good SERVICE has three characteristics.</p>
<p>1. The operation relates to a domain concept that is not a natural part of an ENTITY or VALUE
OBJECT .
2. The interface is defined in terms of other elements of the domain model.
3. The operation is stateless.</p>
<p>Statelessness here means that any client can use any instance of a particular SERVICE without
regard to the instance&#8217;s individual history. The execution of a SERVICE will use information that is
accessible globally, and may even change that global information (that is, it may have side
effects). But the SERVICE does not hold state of its own that affects its own behavior, as most
domain objects do.</p>
<p>When a significant process or transformation in the domain is not a natural
responsibility of an ENTITY or VALUE OBJECT , add an operation to the model as a
standalone interface declared as a SERVICE . Define the interface in terms of the
language of the model and make sure the operation name is part of the UBIQUITOUS
LANGUAGE . Make the SERVICE stateless.</p>

</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Most SERVICES discussed in the literature are purely technical and belong in the infrastructure layer.
Domain and application SERVICES collaborate with these infrastructure SERVICES.
For example, a bank might have an application that sends an e-mail to a customer when an account balance falls below a specific threshold.
The interface that encapsulates the e-mail system, and perhaps alternate means of notification, is a SERVICE in the infrastructure layer.</p>
<p>It can be harder to distinguish application SERVICES from domain SERVICES.
The application layer is responsible for ordering the notification.
The domain layer is responsible for determining if a threshold was met—though this task probably does not call for a SERVICE, because it would fit the responsibility of an &#8220;account&#8221; object.
That banking application could be responsible for funds transfers.
If a SERVICE were devised to make appropriate debits and credits for a funds transfer,that capability would belong in the domain layer.
Funds transfer has a meaning in the banking domain language, and it involves fundamental business logic.
Technical SERVICES should lack any business meaning at all.</p>
<p>Many domain or application SERVICES are built on top of the populations of ENTITIES and VALUES, behaving like scripts that organize the potential of the domain to actually get something done.
ENTITIES and VALUE OBJECTS are often too fine-grained to provide a convenient access to the capabilities of the domain layer.
Here we encounter a very fine line between the domain layer and the application layer.
For example, if the banking application can convert and export our transactions into a spreadsheet file for us to analyze, that export is an application SERVICE.
There is no meaning of &#8220;file formats&#8221; in the domain of banking, and there are no business rules involved.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a feature that can transfer funds from one account to another is a domain SERVICE because it embeds significant business rules (crediting and debiting the appropriate accounts, for example) and because a &#8220;funds transfer&#8221; is a meaningful banking term.
In this case, the SERVICE does not do much on its own; it would ask the two Account objects to do most of the work.
But to put the &#8220;transfer&#8221; operation on the Account object would be awkward, because the operation involves two accounts and some global rules.</p>

<div><p>Domain Models (116) are preferable to Transaction Scripts (110) for avoiding domain logic duplication and
for managing complexity using classical design patterns.
But putting application logic into pure domain object classes has a couple of undesirable consequences.
First, domain object classes are less reusable across applications if they implement application-specific logic and depend on application-specific packages.
Second, commingling both kinds of logic in the same classes makes it harder to reimplement the application
logic in, say, a workflow tool if that should ever become desirable.
For these reasons Service Layer factors each kind of business logic into a separate layer, yielding the usual benefits of layering and rendering the pure domain object classes more reusable from application to application.</p>

You’ll see that demonstrated later in the chapter.

<p>Infrastructure Service should be separate of other types of Service.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The infrastructure layer usually does not initiate action in the domain layer. Being &#8220;below&#8221; the
domain layer, it should have no specific knowledge of the domain it is serving. Indeed, such
technical capabilities are most often offered as SERVICES . For example, if an application needs to
send an e-mail, some message-sending interface can be located in the infrastructure layer and the
application layer elements can request the transmission of the message. This decoupling gives
some extra versatility. The message-sending interface might be connected to an e-mail sender, a
fax sender, or whatever else is available. But the main benefit is simplifying the application layer,
keeping it narrowly focused on its job: knowing when to send a message, but not burdened with
how.</p>
<p>The application and domain layers call on the SERVICES provided by the infrastructure layer. When
the scope of a SERVICE has been well chosen and its interface well designed, the caller can remain
loosely coupled and uncomplicated by the elaborate behavior the SERVICE interface encapsulates.</p>
<p>But not all infrastructure comes in the form of SERVICES callable from the higher layers. Some
technical components are designed to directly support the basic functions of other layers (such as
providing an abstract base class for all domain objects) and provide the mechanisms for them to
relate (such as implementations of MVC and the like). Such an &#8220;architectural framework&#8221; has
much more impact on the design of the other parts of the program.</p>

<div><p>A common approach in handling domain logic is to split the domain layer in two. A Service Layer (133) is
placed over an underlying Domain Model (116) or Table Module (125). Usually you only get this with a
Domain Model (116) or Table Module (125) since a domain layer that uses only Transaction Script (110) isn&#8217;t
complex enough to warrant a separate layer. The presentation logic interacts with the domain purely through
the Service Layer (133), which acts as an API for the application.</p>
<p>As well as providing a clear API, the Service Layer (133) is also a good spot to place such things as
transaction control and security. This gives you a simple model of taking each method in the Service Layer
(133) and describing its transactional and security characteristics. A separate properties file is a common
choice for this, but .NET&#8217;s attributes provide a nice way of doing it directly in the code.</p>

<p>Traditionally <a class="reference external" href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/serviceLayer.html">Service Layer</a> is an Application layer logic.
This implies that level of Service Layer is lower than level of Domain Layer (i.e. layer of real world objects, which is also called &#8220;business rules&#8221;).
This means that the objects of the Domain Layer should not be aware of the Service Layer.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the Service Layer can carry the following responsibilities:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>To combine the parts of an atomic operation (for example, application should save the data to several storages, e.g. database, redis, file system within a single business transaction or should roll back all).</li>
<li>To hide the data source (here it duplicates the responsibility of the pattern <a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html">Repository</a>) and can be omitted if there are no other reasons.</li>
<li>To aggregate the application level operations that are being reused by several clients (for example, some part of application-level logic is used in several different controllers).</li>
<li>As basis for implementation of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/remoteFacade.html">Remote Facade</a>.</li>
<li>When you have a large controller method, you have to do decomposition. Thus, you apply <a class="reference external" href="https://www.refactoring.com/catalog/extractMethod.html">Extract Method</a> to separate each responsibility into own method. When you did it, you found that the class lost its focus. The quantity of methods has been increased that means the <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.c2.com/?CouplingAndCohesion">Cohesion</a> (i.e. coefficient of sharing the class&#8217; properties by the class&#8217; methods) has been reduced. To restore the <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.c2.com/?CouplingAndCohesion">Cohesion</a> you have to extraсt these methods into separate <a class="reference external" href="https://www.refactoring.com/catalog/replaceMethodWithMethodObject.html">Method Object</a>, which can be used as a Service Layer.</li>
<li>The Service Layer can be used as an aggregator for queries if it is over the <a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html">Repository</a> pattern and uses the <a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/queryObject.html">Query object</a> pattern. The fact is that the Repository pattern limits its interface using the Query Object interface. And since class does not have to make assumptions about its clients, it is impossible to accumulate pre-defined queries in the <a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html">Repository</a> class, because it can not be aware about the all needs of all clients. Clients should take care of themselves. But the Service Layer was created for client service. Therefore, it&#8217;s a responsibility of the Service Layer.</li>

<p>In other cases, the logic of the Service Layer can be placed directly at the application level (usually a controller).</p>

<div><p>The easier question to answer is probably when not to use it. You probably don&#8217;t need a Service Layer if your
application&#8217;s business logic will only have one kind of client say, a user interface and its use case responses
don&#8217;t involve multiple transactional resources. In this case your Page Controllers can manually control
transactions and coordinate whatever response is required, perhaps delegating directly to the Data Source
layer.
But as soon as you envision a second kind of client, or a second transactional resource in use case responses, it
pays to design in a Service Layer from the beginning.</p>

A Data Mapper serves a Domain Model, a Repository serves an Aggregate <a class="footnote-reference" href="#fnnetmsa" id="id23">[8]</a>, but a Service serves a client (or a client group).
The Service Layer can manipulate multiple Data Mappers, Repositories, other Services within a business transaction and in favour of a client.
Therefore, Service&#8217;s methods usually contain name of the returned Domain Model as a suffix (for example, getUser()), while methods of a Data Mapper (or a Repository) do not need such suffix (since the Domain name is already present in name of the Data Mapper class, and the Data Mapper serves only one Domain Model).</p>

The same approach can be used for parallel development, when the implementation of the Service Layer is not ready yet.

<p>A common mistake is to use the django.db.models.Manager class (and even django.db.models.Model) as a Service Layer.
Often you can see how some method of the class django.db.models.Model takes as an argument the HTTP-request object django.http.request.HttpRequest, for example, to check the permissions.</p>
<p>The HTTP request object is the Application Layer logic, while the model class is the logic of the Domain Layer, i.e. objects of the real world, which are also called business rules.

<p>Although Django does not use the <a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html">Repository</a> pattern, it uses an abstraction of the selection criteria in the form similar to the <a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/queryObject.html">Query Object</a> pattern.
Like the Repository pattern, the model class (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html">ActiveRecord</a>) limits its interface using the Query Object interface.
Clients should use the provided interface, rather than impose their responsibilities on the Model and its Manager on knowledge of their queries.
And since class does not have to make assumptions about its clients, it is impossible to accumulate pre-defined queries in the Model class, because it can not be aware about the all needs of all clients.
Clients should take care of themselves.
But the Service Layer was created for client service.
Therefore, it&#8217;s a responsibility of the Service Layer.</p>
<p>Attempts to exclude the Serving Layer from Django applications leads to the appearance of Managers with a lot of methods.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>Some might also argue that the application logic responsibilities could be implemented in domain object
methods, such as Contract.calculateRevenueRecognitions(), or even in the data source layer,
thereby eliminating the need for a separate Service Layer. However, I find those allocations of responsibility
undesirable for a number of reasons. First, domain object classes are less reusable across applications if they
implement application-specific logic (and depend on application-specific Gateways (466), and the like). They
should model the parts of the problem domain that are of interest to the application, which doesn&#8217;t mean all of
application&#8217;s use case responsibilities. Second, encapsulating application logic in a &#8220;higher&#8221; layer

<p>It is often possible to find models with a large number of methods (I met several hundred).
If you analyze such models, you can often find outside responsibilities in the class.
As you know, the size of the class is measured by the amount of its responsibilities.
All responsibilities that are not related to the Domain Layer should be moved to the Service Layer.
But what to do with other methods?</p>
<p>Suppose some Model has several dozen methods that do not have a common application, but are used by only one client.
You can not assign them to the responsibility of the client, as this would lead to &#8220;G14: Feature Envy&#8221; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#fnccode" id="id30">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, the client requires an interface from the Domain Model, which should not be implemented by the Domain Model.
For interface equalization we have to use the pattern Adapter (aka Wrapper), see &#8220;Design Patterns Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software&#8221; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#fngof" id="id31">[5]</a> for more info.</p>
<p>In other words, it is a wrapper over the Model instance that wraps it and gives it additional behavior that is required by the client.
Sometimes such wrappers are wrongly called Aspect or Decorator, but this is incorrect, since they do not change the interface of the original object.</p>
<p>Is it possible to use the Adapter pattern in this case?</p>
<p>Martin Fowler says:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The two basic implementation variations are the domain facade approach and the operation script approach. In
the domain facade approach a Service Layer is implemented as a set of thin facades over a Domain Model
(116). The classes implementing the facades don&#8217;t implement any business logic. Rather, the Domain Model
(116) implements all of the business logic. The thin facades establish a boundary and set of operations through
which client layers interact with the application, exhibiting the defining characteristics of Service Layer.</p>
<p>In the operation script approach a Service Layer is implemented as a set of thicker classes that directly
implement application logic but delegate to encapsulated domain object classes for domain logic. The
operations available to clients of a Service Layer are implemented as scripts, organized several to a class
defining a subject area of related logic. Each such class forms an application &#8220;service,&#8221; and it&#8217;s common for
service type names to end with &#8220;Service.&#8221; A Service Layer is comprised of these application service classes,
which should extend a Layer Supertype (475), abstracting their responsibilities and common behaviors.</p>

<div><p>We might like to create a Funds Transfer object to represent the two entries plus the rules and history around the transfer. But we are still left with calls to SERVICES in the interbank networks.
What&#8217;s more, in most development systems, it is awkward to make a direct interface between a domain object and external resources. We can dress up such external SERVICES with a FACADE that takes inputs in terms of the model, perhaps returning a Funds Transfer object as its result.
But whatever intermediaries we might have, and even though they don&#8217;t belong to us, those SERVICES are carrying out the domain responsibility of funds transfer.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id61">Problems of Django annotation</a><a class="headerlink" href="#problems-of-django-annotation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>I often observed the problem when a new field was added to the Django Model, and multiple problems started to occur, since this name was already used either with the annotation interface or with Raw-SQL.
Also, the implementation of annotations by Django ORM makes it impossible to use the pattern <a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/identityMap.html">Identity Map</a>.
Storm ORM / SQLAlchemy implement annotations more successfully.
If you still had to work with Django Model, refrain from using Django annotation mechanism in favor of bare pattern <a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataMapper.html">DataMapper</a>.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id62">Peculiar properties of Service Layer on client side</a><a class="headerlink" href="#peculiar-properties-of-service-layer-on-client-side" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Using the <a class="reference external" href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DDD_Aggregate.html">Aggregate</a> concept and reactive programming libraries, such as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs">RxJS</a>, allows us to implement Service Layer using a simplest pattern like <a class="reference external" href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/gateway.html">Gateway</a>, see, for example, <a class="reference external" href="https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt6">the tutorial of Angular documentation</a>.
In this case, <a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/queryObject.html">Query Object</a> is usually implemented as a simple dictionary, which is then converted to a list of GET parameters for the URL.
Such service usually communicates with a server either through JSON-RPC, or through <a class="reference external" href="http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/viewsets/#viewset-actions">REST-API Actions</a>.</p>
<p>Everything works well until you need to express prioritized queries, for example, using the logical operator &#8220;OR&#8221; which has a lower priority than the logical operator &#8220;AND&#8221;.
This raises the question of who should be responsible for building the query, the Service Layer of the client or the Service Layer of the server?</p>
<p>On the one hand, the server should not make assumptions about its clients, and must limit its interface through the interface <a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/queryObject.html">Query Object</a>.
But this dramatically increases the level of complexity of the client, in particular, the implementation of <a class="reference external" href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/serviceStub.html">Service Stub</a>.
To facilitate implementation, you can use the library <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/persvr/rql">rql</a> mentioned in the article &#8220;<a class="reference internal" href="../javascript-and-repository-pattern/"><span class="doc">Implementation of Repository pattern for browser&#8217;s JavaScript</span></a>&#8221;.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Service Layer, albeit a remote call, is designed to serve clients, so it can concentrate the logic of query building.
If the client does not contain complex logic, allowing to interpret the prioritized queries for Service Stub, then no need to complicate it.
In this case, it&#8217;s easier to add a new method to the remote call service, and get rid of the need for prioritized queries.</p>
