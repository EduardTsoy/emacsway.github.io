There are two excellent reference applications implementing Event-Driven Architecture:

1. https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers (CQRS, DDD, Microservices)
2. https://github.com/microsoftarchive/cqrs-journey (Event Sourcing, SAGA transactions)

They both have comprehensive guides:

1. https://aka.ms/microservicesebook
2. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/previous-versions/msp-n-p/jj554200(v=pandp.10)

    "A perect example of this if you go look at the CQRS and Event Sourcing by Microsoft Patterns and Practices."
