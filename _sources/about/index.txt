About me
--------

A Software Design and Agile expert.

.. Was participated in development of software for various business domains - B2B and marketplace platforms, social networks, enterprise content management systems, content aggregators, GIS and travel portals, brainstorm tools etc.

My main interest is to make the code clean, simple and maintainable; the implementation of new features :doc:`rapid and cheap <../en/how-to-quickly-develop-high-quality-code>`; the curve of cost of code change asymptotic (instead of exponential); the risks low; the team successful.

Real experience of establishing economically successful Agile development. Deep background in XP, TDD, DDD, Refactoring, Evolutionary Design, Clean Code/Architecture, Microservices and others. Extensive :doc:`bibliography <./bibliography>`.

Also I'm an Open Source `developer <Open Source Projects_>`__ and an adherent of `KISS <https://people.apache.org/~fhanik/kiss.html>`_ principle. My philosophy is: "Do it shortly, clearly".


Open Source Projects
--------------------

* Python
    * `rope <https://github.com/python-rope/rope>`_ (contributor) - a python refactoring library.
    * `SQLBuilder <https://bitbucket.org/emacsway/sqlbuilder>`_ (author) - a lightweight Python SQLBuilder. Can be integrated with Django.
    * `cache-dependencies <https://bitbucket.org/emacsway/cache-dependencies>`_ (author). Cache-dependencies (former Cache-tagging) allows you easily invalidate all cache records tagged with a given tag(s). The package supports Django.
    * `Ascetic ORM <https://bitbucket.org/emacsway/ascetic>`_ (author) - a lightweight Python DataMapper ORM (the project is incomplete).

* JavaScript
    * `Store.js <https://github.com/emacsway/store>`_ (lead contributor) - a super lightweight implementation of Repository pattern for relational data and aggregates. The library allows you to use Domain-Driven Design (DDD) on client-side as well as reactive programming. (`canonical repo <https://github.com/joor/store-js-external>`__).

    "The design goal for Eventlet’s API is simplicity and readability. You should be able to read its code and understand what it’s doing. Fewer lines of code are preferred over excessively clever implementations." (`Eventlet’s docs <http://eventlet.net/doc/basic_usage.html>`__)

    "Simplicity and elegance are unpopular because they require hard work and discipline to achieve and education to be appreciated." (Edsger W. Dijkstra)

    "Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability." (Edsger W. Dijkstra)

    "Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better." (Edsger W. Dijkstra, 1984 `On the nature of Computing Science <http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD896.html>`__ (EWD896))

    "A little time spent refactoring can make the code better communicate its purpose. Programming in this mode is all about saying exactly what you mean." ("Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code", Martin Fowler)

    "programmers will have to wrestle with the messy real world." (Steve McConnel)

    "We become authorities and experts in the practical and scientific spheres by so many separate acts and hours of work. If a person keeps faithfully busy each hour of the working day, he can count on waking up some morning to find himself one of the competent ones of his generation." (William James)

    "I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete according to an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. Clean code does one thing well." (Bjarne Stroustrup, inventor of C++ and author of The C++ Programming Language.)

    In most contexts higher quality ⇒ expensive. But high internal quality of software allows us to develop features faster and cheaper. ("`Tradable Quality Hypothesis <https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TradableQualityHypothesis.html>`__" by Martin Fowler)

    The value of good software design is economic: you can continue to add new functionality quickly even as the code-base grows in size. ("`Design Stamina Hypothesis <https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DesignStaminaHypothesis.html>`__" by Martin Fowler)

    "Clean code - is ability of code to express the truth about itself, and not misleading."
