About me
--------

A bearded developer since 2004.

My main interest is to make the code clean, simple, readable, modifiable and maintainable.
My approaches are TDD_, OOP_, OOD_, DDD_, XP_, `Design Patterns`_, `Inversion Of Control`_, Refactoring_, `Software Architectural Design`_ and so on.

Terms such as the Coupling_, Cohesion_, SRP_, OCP_ are not empty words for me.

Also I'm an Open Source developer. Sure, I'm an adherent of `KISS principle <KISS_>`_. My philosophy is: «Do it shortly, clearly».

My guiding light is:

    "I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete according to an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. Clean code does one thing well." (Bjarne Stroustrup, inventor of C++ and author of The C++ Programming Language.)

Open Source Projects
--------------------

* `rope <https://github.com/python-rope/rope>`_ (contributor) - a python refactoring library.

    "The design goal for Eventlet’s API is simplicity and readability. You should be able to read its code and understand what it’s doing. Fewer lines of code are preferred over excessively clever implementations." (`Eventlet’s docs <http://eventlet.net/doc/basic_usage.html>`__)

    "Simplicity and elegance are unpopular because they require hard work and discipline to achieve and education to be appreciated." (Edsger W. Dijkstra)

    "Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability." (Edsger W. Dijkstra)

    "Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better." (Edsger W. Dijkstra, 1984 `On the nature of Computing Science <http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD896.html>`__ (EWD896))

    "A little time spent refactoring can make the code better communicate its purpose. Programming in this mode is all about saying exactly what you mean." ("Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code", Martin Fowler)

    "programmers will have to wrestle with the messy real world." (Steve McConnel)

    "We become authorities and experts in the practical and scientific spheres by so many separate acts and hours of work. If a person keeps faithfully busy each hour of the working day, he can count on waking up some morning to find himself one of the competent ones of his generation." (William James)

    "Clean code - is ability of code to express the truth about itself, and not misleading."
